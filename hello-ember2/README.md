# Hello World For Ember2
A simple hello world project for ember2.
## Notes
This is disappointing, no code. Instead just do this.

```bash
npm install ember-cli -g
ember new hello-ember2
cd hello-ember2
ember server
```

Now this generates all the hello world for you. Unfortunately it creates a LOT
of stuff. You can't really decide how to organize your project as I see it.
