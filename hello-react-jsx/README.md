# Hello World For React JSX
A simple hello world project for React JSX.
## Notes
The browser.min.js file is from: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-core/5.8.23/browser.min.js

The current version of babel core does not work in the browser (sigh). You need a builder for it to work.

This install uses bower, but bootstraps it via npm start.

To Install:

```bash
npm install 
npm start
```
